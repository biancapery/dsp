[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF.

Is the distribution uniform?

t = np.random.random(1000)
The warning message says "No handles with labels found to put in legend". 

pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(t)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=0.1)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='PMF')

cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(t)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='CDF')

After 1000 random points, the distribution is close to uniform but it is not an absolutely uniform distribution. It would get closer to uniform with larger numbers of trials.
